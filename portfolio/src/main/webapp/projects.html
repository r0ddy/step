                            AnimalBytes is an app that I worked on during
                            Cornell's Digital Agriculture Hackathon. It's
                            a mobile app made to hourly check the emotional
                            status of various farm animals. This helps
                            farmers detect distress that may be related to
                            disease, quickly and efficiently.

                        <p>
                            Pioneer is an app that I made for the Program
                            for Research in Youth Development and Engagement
                            (PRYDE) at Cornell. I created a survey app for
                            researchers to anonymously collect diary entries 
                            from youth. Researchers at PRYDE can then view all
                            their collected data on a dashboard to view
                            and export as they wish. 
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <img class="projectImage" src="/images/eve.png"/>
                        <p>
                            Eve is an app that I helped make as a part of 
                            Cornell's Design & Tech Initiative (DTI). At DTI,
                            we make apps that help Cornellians in their everyday
                            lives. In particular, Eve is a central repository
                            for any event at Cornell. We help students filter and
                            identify events and then notify them of any events
                            they plan on attending.
