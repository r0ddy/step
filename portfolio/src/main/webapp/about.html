                <p>
                    I am a Peruvian American developer from NJ,
                    and I enjoy working with others to create
                    tech products with impact. For the past
                    couple years, I've worked on many projects
                    using my skills to create full-stack web and
                    mobile apps for research groups, startups, and
                    small private companies. I've also just
                    finished my sophomore year at Cornell University
                    where I major in Computer Science. At Cornell,
                    I am a part of Cornell's Design Tech Initiative,
                    a project team that creates tech for Cornell students.
                    I also played in Cornell's intramural basketball league.
                    This summer, I am interning as a STEP intern at
                    Google on the NBU Monetization team.
