                <h1>Rodrigo "Roddy" Taipe</h1>
                <p>
                Hello there! My name is Rodrigo Taipe, 
                but everyone calls me Roddy. I am from 
                northern NJ and ever since I can remember,  
                I’ve always loved to make things. It’s why 
                I decided to pursue a career in software 
                engineering. You can design, build, and 
                test as many times as you want with very 
                little cost (except for time) and you can 
                do it all by just using resources you 
                find online. All it takes is some coffee, 
                a laptop, and an Internet connection to 
                get me in the coding zone. Anyways, feel 
                free to check out my website to get to 
                know me better!
