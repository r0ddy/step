                    Welcome to my blog page! This is where I talk about things
                    going on in my life and my opinion on current events.

                            The reason I start my blog with a post about my second week
                            at Google is because not much happened during my short week 1.
                            During my first week, I was just setting up my machine and
                            getting to know my hosts and pod. It was during my second week
                            that I learned more.
